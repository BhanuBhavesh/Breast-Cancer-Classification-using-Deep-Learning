# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the code and documentation for a breast cancer classification project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast cancer tumo This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in the automated classification of breast tumors.  

Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer affecting millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate classification of breast tumors is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in the automated classification of breast tumors.

The dataset used for this project is from the Sklearn Dataset of Jupyter Notebook. It contains 30 features on which it is dependent and is split into training and testing sets.
